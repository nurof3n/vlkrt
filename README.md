# Vlkrt

This repository contains the source code for a simple Vulkan multiplayer game engine.
It contains a client and a headless server, both implemented using the [Walnut framework](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut).

It aims to provide a Hybrid approach to rendering, with rasterization and ray tracing.
